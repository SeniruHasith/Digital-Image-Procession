Image Classification for Cancer Detection

This project is a deep learning-based application that can classify images as either "Normal" or "Malignant" for cancer detection. The model is trained on a dataset of medical images and can be used to predict the classification of new, uploaded images.

The key features of this project include:

1. Automatic loading and preprocessing of image data
2. Flexible model building and training, with support for GPU acceleration
3. Ability to load and use a pre-trained model, avoiding unnecessary retraining
4. Integration with a Flask web application for easy deployment and interaction

This project can serve as a starting point for building medical image classification systems or can be adapted for other image-based classification tasks. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or contribute to the ongoing development.
